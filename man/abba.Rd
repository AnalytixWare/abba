\title{Automatic Binary Binning Algorithm (abba) for this to work you need include
the focus functions and the info loss functions Takes in an abba.bin object
and performs a binning}
\usage{
abba(abbabin, infoloss_fn = abba.pearson.loss,
  focus_fn = abba.trendup_pearson_min_pop_bad_min_woe_diff_max_num_bins_focus,
  maxiter = Inf, verbose = FALSE, tryoptimise = FALSE,
  collapseZeroes = TRUE, ordered = TRUE, greedier = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{abbabin}{The abbabin object to bin}

\item{infoloss_fn}{The information loss function used to determine the amount
of infomration loss when combining bins. The results are then used to to
focus on the problem bins}

\item{focus_fn}{Whic of the bins to focus on. The focussed on bins will be
considered for merging}

\item{maxiter}{The maximum number of iteration. Defaults to Inf which means
there is no limit to the maximum number of iterations}

\item{verbose}{Print out more error messages?}

\item{tryoptimise}{A boolean for try to run some optimisation algorithm or not. This feature has been disabledd}

\item{collapseZeroes}{Try to collapse bins with zeroes or not as the first step in the algorithm}

\item{ordered}{Whether the bin is ordinal (not yet implemented)}

\item{greedier}{Will attempt to combine more bins in one go (not yet implemented)}

\item{...}{Other arugment to go into the focus_fn or infoloss_fn}
}
\value{
An abbabin object binned
}
